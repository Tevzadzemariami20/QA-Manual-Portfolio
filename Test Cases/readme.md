# 🧩 Test Cases (Based on Real Bug Reports)

## Overview
This folder contains **manual test cases created based on real, identified defects** during testing of web applications.  
All test cases are **NDA-safe** and written using **industry-standard QA practices**.

Each test case is designed to validate functionality related to a specific bug and ensure the issue is **reproducible, verifiable, and regression-safe**.

## 🔗 Traceability
Each test case:
- Is linked to a **specific Bug ID** from the *Bug Reports* folder
- Provides clear **steps to reproduce the issue**
- Includes **expected vs actual behavior**
- Supports **regression testing** after bug fixes

This demonstrates strong traceability between:
**Requirements → Test Cases → Bug Reports**

## 📂 Test Case Coverage
The test cases cover critical functional areas including:

- 🛒 E-commerce navigation & product filtering
- ❤️ Wishlist / Favorites functionality
- 🔐 Authentication & registration flows
- 🌐 Language & localization switching
- 🔍 Search and filtering behavior
- 💬 Chat features & user interactions
- 📜 Terms of Service & UI validation

## 🧾 Test Case Structure
Each test case follows an **ISTQB-style structure** and includes:

- **Test Case ID**
- **Title**
- **Feature / Module**
- **Scenario / Purpose**
- **Priority**
- **Pre-conditions**
- **Test Steps**
- **Expected Result**
- **Actual Result**
- **Status (Pass / Fail)**  
- **Related Bug ID (if applicable)**

## 🎯 Purpose
These test cases were created to:

- Validate critical user flows and application behavior
- Reproduce and verify reported defects
- Provide regression coverage for fixed issues
- Demonstrate structured test design and analytical thinking
- Showcase professional QA documentation skills

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used
- Manual functional testing
- Exploratory testing
- Regression testing
- UI/UX validation
- Chrome DevTools (UI & Network inspection)
- Jira-style workflow for linking Test Cases ↔ Bug Reports
